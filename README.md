# SOP
Example of document creation for standard operating procedures. 

The Sysmex analysis system is a comprehensive hematology analyzer used in many complex-testing laboratories within health-care networks. Standard operating procedures are built upon manufacturer guidelines and tailored to the specific needs of the health-care facility and its specific patient population. SOPs are routinely updated and appended to include new guidlines, features, limitations, or adaptations. 

The SOP in this repository is an example that was built out for a 300-bed acute-care hospital and Level 2 trauma center, whose staff consists mainly of MLS-level technicians and operators. The patient population skews heavily older, with a large undocumented and undomiciled segment, with their attending high-level needs and complications.
